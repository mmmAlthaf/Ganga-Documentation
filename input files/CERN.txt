CERN
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (French: Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire), known as CERN (/sɜːrn/; French pronunciation: [sɛʁn]; derived from the name Conseil européen pour
la recherche nucléaire), is a European research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, the organization is based in a northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco–
Swiss border and has 22 member states.[3] Israel is the only non-European country granted full membership.[4] CERN is an oﬃcial United Nations Observer.[5]
The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory, which in 2016 had 2,500 scientiﬁc, technical, and administrative staﬀ members, and hosted about 12,000 users. In the same year, CERN generated 49 petabytes

of data.[6]
CERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international
collaborations. The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyse data from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities,
so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.[7][8]

and Werner Heisenberg said that this could "still be CERN even if the name is [not]".

CERN's ﬁrst president was Sir Benjamin Lockspeiser. Edoardo Amaldi was the general secretary of CERN at its early stages when operations were still provisional, while the
ﬁrst Director-General (1954) was Felix Bloch.[10]
The laboratory was originally devoted to the study of atomic nuclei, but was soon applied to higher-energy physics, concerned mainly with the study of interactions between subatomic particles. Therefore, the laboratory
operated by CERN is commonly referred to as the European laboratory for particle physics (Laboratoire européen pour la physique des particules), which better describes the research being performed there.

Founding members
At the sixth session of the CERN Council, which took place in Paris from 29 June - 1 July 1953, the convention establishing the organization was signed, subject to ratiﬁcation, by 12 states. The convention was gradually
ratiﬁed by the 12 founding Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia.[11]

Scientiﬁc achievements
Several important achievements in particle physics have been made through experiments at CERN. They include:
1973: The discovery of neutral currents in the Gargamelle bubble chamber;[12]
1983: The discovery of W and Z bosons in the UA1 and UA2 experiments;[13]
1989: The determination of the number of light neutrino families at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) operating on the Z boson peak;
1995: The ﬁrst creation of antihydrogen atoms in the PS210 experiment;[14]
1999: The discovery of direct CP violation in the NA48 experiment;[15]
2010: The isolation of 38 atoms of antihydrogen;[16]
2011: Maintaining antihydrogen for over 15 minutes;[17]
2012: A boson with mass around 125 GeV/c2 consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson.[18]
In September 2011, CERN attracted media attention when the OPERA Collaboration reported the detection of possibly faster-than-light neutrinos.[19] Further tests showed that the results were ﬂawed due to an incorrectly connected GPS synchronization cable.[20]
The 1984 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer for the developments that resulted in the discoveries of the W and Z bosons. The 1992 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to CERN staﬀ researcher Georges Charpak "for his
invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber". The 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to François Englert and Peter Higgs for the theoretical description of the Higgs mechanism in the year after the Higgs boson
was found by CERN experiments.

Computer science
The World Wide Web began as a CERN project named ENQUIRE, initiated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and Robert Cailliau in 1990.[21] Berners-Lee and Cailliau were jointly honoured by the Association for Computing Machinery in 1995 for their contributions to the
development of the World Wide Web.
Based on the concept of hypertext, the project was intended to facilitate the sharing of information between researchers. The ﬁrst website was activated in 1991. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone. A copy[22] of the
original ﬁrst webpage (http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html), created by Berners-Lee, is still published on the World Wide Web Consortium's website as a historical document.
Prior to the Web's development, CERN had pioneered the introduction of Internet technology, beginning in the early 1980s.[23]
More recently, CERN has become a facility for the development of grid computing, hosting projects including the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) and LHC Computing Grid. It also hosts the CERN Internet Exchange Point (CIXP), one of the two main internet
exchange points in Switzerland.

Particle accelerators

Current complex
CERN operates a network of six accelerators and a decelerator. Each machine in the chain increases the energy of particle beams
before delivering them to experiments or to the next more powerful accelerator. Currently active machines are:
Two linear accelerators generate low energy particles. LINAC 2 accelerates protons to 50 MeV for
injection into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), and LINAC 3 provides heavy ions at 4.2 MeV/u
for injection into the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR). [24]
The Proton Synchrotron Booster increases the energy of particles generated by the proton linear
accelerator before they are transferred to the other accelerators.
The Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) accelerates the ions from the ion linear accelerator, before
transferring them to the Proton Synchrotron (PS). This accelerator was commissioned in 2005, after
having been reconﬁgured from the previous Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR).

The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), a circular accelerator with a diameter of 2 kilometres built in a
tunnel, which started operation in 1976. It was designed to deliver an energy of 300 GeV and was
gradually upgraded to 450 GeV. As well as having its own beamlines for ﬁxed-target experiments (currently COMPASS and NA62), it has been operated as a proton–
antiproton collider (the SppS collider), and for accelerating high energy electrons and positrons which were injected into the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP). Since
2008, it has been used to inject protons and heavy ions into the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The On-Line Isotope Mass Separator (ISOLDE), which is used to study unstable nuclei. The radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of
1.0–1.4 GeV from the Proton Synchrotron Booster. It was ﬁrst commissioned in 1967 and was rebuilt with major upgrades in 1974 and 1992.
The Antiproton Decelerator (AD), which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about 10% of the speed of light for research of antimatter.
The Compact Linear Collider Test Facility, which studies feasibility for the future normal conducting linear collider project.
The AWAKE experiment, which is a proof-of-principle plasma wakeﬁeld accelerator.

Large Hadron Collider

List of current particle
accelerators at CERN

Many activities at CERN currently involve operating the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the experiments for it. The LHC represents a large-scale, worldwide scientiﬁc cooperation project.
The LHC tunnel is located 100 metres underground, in the region between the Geneva International Airport and the nearby Jura mountains. The majority of its length is on the French side of the border. It uses the 27 km
circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP), which was shut down in November 2000. CERN's existing PS/SPS accelerator complexes are used to pre-accelerate
protons and lead ions which are then injected into the LHC.

Seven experiments (CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, MoEDAL,[25] TOTEM, LHC-forward and ALICE) are located along the collider; each of them studies particle collisions from a diﬀerent aspect, and with diﬀerent
technologies. Construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering eﬀort. For example, a special crane was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into its underground cavern, since
each piece weighed nearly 2,000 tons. The ﬁrst of the approximately 5,000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at 13:00 GMT on 7 March 2005.
The LHC has begun to generate vast quantities of data, which CERN streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing (making use of a specialized grid infrastructure, the LHC Computing Grid).
During April 2005, a trial successfully streamed 600 MB/s to seven diﬀerent sites across the world.

The LHC resumed operation on 20 November 2009 by successfully circulating two beams, each with an energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV). The challenge for the engineers was then to try to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other. This is like "ﬁring
two needles across the Atlantic and getting them to hit each other" according to Steve Myers, director for accelerators and technology.
On 30 March 2010, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 3.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a 7 TeV collision energy. However, this was just the start of what was needed for the expected discovery of the Higgs boson. When the 7 TeV experimental
period ended, the LHC revved to 8 TeV (4 TeV per proton) starting March 2012, and soon began particle collisions at that energy. In July 2012, CERN scientists announced the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle that was later conﬁrmed to be the Higgs boson.[28] In
March 2013, CERN announced that the measurements performed on the newly found particle allowed it to conclude that this is a Higgs boson.[29] In early 2013, the LHC was deactivated for a two-year maintenance period, to strengthen the electrical connections between
magnets inside the accelerator and for other upgrades.

On 5 April 2015, after two years of maintenance and consolidation, the LHC restarted for a second run. The ﬁrst ramp to the record-breaking energy of 6.5 TeV was performed on 10
April 2015.[30][31] In 2016, the design collision rate was exceeded for the ﬁrst time.[32] A second two-year period of shutdown is scheduled to begin at the end of 2018.

Possible future accelerators

Map of the Large Hadron
Collider together with the Super
Proton Synchrotron at CERN

CERN, in collaboration with groups worldwide, is investigating two main concepts for future accelerators: A linear electron-positron collider with a new acceleration concept to increase
the energy (CLIC) and a larger version of the LHC, a project currently named Future Circular Collider.[33]

Sites
The smaller accelerators are on the main Meyrin site (also known as the West Area), which was originally built in Switzerland alongside the French border, but has been extended to span the border since 1965. The French
side is under Swiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site, apart from a line of marker stones.
The SPS and LEP/LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, and are mostly buried under French farmland and invisible from the surface. However, they have surface sites at various points around them, either as
the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts. The experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at
these sites.
Three of these experimental sites are in France, with ATLAS in Switzerland, although some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in Switzerland. The largest of the experimental sites is the Prévessin site, also known
as the North Area, which is the target station for non-collider experiments on the SPS accelerator. Other sites are the ones which were used for the UA1, UA2 and the LEP experiments (the latter are used by LHC
experiments).
Outside of the LEP and LHC experiments, most are oﬃcially named and numbered after the site where they were located. For example, NA32 was an experiment looking at the production of so-called "charmed" particles
and located at the Prévessin (North Area) site while WA22 used the Big European Bubble Chamber (BEBC) at the Meyrin (West Area) site to examine neutrino interactions. The UA1 and UA2 experiments were considered
to be in the Underground Area, i.e. situated underground at sites on the SPS accelerator.
Most of the roads on the CERN Meyrin and Prévessin sites are named after famous physicists, such as Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, and Albert Einstein.

Participation and funding
Member states and budget
Since its foundation by 12 members in 1954, CERN regularly accepted new members. All new members have remained in the organization continuously since their accession, except Spain and Yugoslavia. Spain ﬁrst joined
CERN in 1961, withdrew in 1969, and rejoined in 1983. Yugoslavia was a founding member of CERN but quit in 1961. Of the 22 members, Israel joined CERN as a full member on 6 January 2014,[34] becoming the ﬁrst
(and currently only) non-European full member.[35]
The budget contributions of member states are computed based on their GDP.[36]

Open access publishing
CERN has initiated an open access publishing project to convert scientiﬁc articles in high energy physics into gold open access by redirecting subscription fees. In the ﬁrst phase from 2014-2016 3,000 libraries, consortia, research organisations, publishers and funding
agencies in various countries participated.[70] All publications by CERN authors are published with gold open access.[71]

Public exhibits
Facilities at CERN open to the public include:
The Globe of Science and Innovation, which opened in late 2005 and is used four times a week for special exhibits.
The Microcosm museum on particle physics and CERN history.
CERN also provides daily tours to certain facilities such as the Synchro-cyclotron (CERNs ﬁrst particle accelerator) and the superconducting magnet workshop.

In popular culture
The band Les Horribles Cernettes was founded by women from CERN. The name was chosen so to have the same initials as the LHC. [72][73]
CERN's Large Hadron Collider is the subject of a (scientiﬁcally accurate) rap video starring Katherine McAlpine with some of the facility's staﬀ.[74][75]
Particle Fever, a 2013 documentary, explores CERN throughout the inside and depicts the events surrounding the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson

The Globe of Science and
Innovation at CERN

CERN is depicted in an episode of South Park (Season 13, Episode 6) called "Pinewood Derby". Randy Marsh, the father of one of the main characters, breaks into the "Hadron
Particle Super Collider in Switzerland" and steals a "superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration" to use in his son Stan's Pinewood
Derby racer. Randy breaks into CERN dressed in disguise as Princess Leia from the Star Wars saga. The break-in is captured on surveillance tape which is then broadcast on
the news.[76]
John Titor, a self-proclaimed time traveler, alleged that CERN would invent time travel in 2001.
CERN is depicted in the visual novel/anime series Steins;Gate as SERN, a shadowy organization that has been researching time travel in order to restructure and control the
world.
In Dan Brown's mystery-thriller novel Angels & Demons and ﬁlm of the same name, a canister of antimatter is stolen from CERN.[77]
In the popular children's series The 39 Clues, CERN is said to be an Ekaterina stronghold hiding the clue hydrogen.
In Robert J. Sawyer's science ﬁction novel Flashforward, at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider accelerator is performing a run to search for the Higgs boson when the entire
human race sees themselves twenty-one years and six months in the future.

In 2015, Sarah Charley, US communications manager for LHC experiments at CERN with graduate students Jesse Heilman of the University of California, Riverside, and Tom Perry and Laser Seymour Kaplan of the
University of Wisconsin, Madison created a parody video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1AF7GwAxfI) of “Collide” a song by American artist Howie Day.[80] The lyrics were changed to be from the
perspective of a proton in the Large Hadron Collider. After seeing the parody, Day re-recorded the song with the new lyrics and in February, 2017 Day released this new version of "Collide" in a video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YB0xM9cgr8) created during his visit to CERN.[81]
